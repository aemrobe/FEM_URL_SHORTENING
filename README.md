### Useful resources

- [The Complete Javascript Course By Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - This helped me to get back to read about the javascript stuff which I need to do the work in this challelnge.

- [Tiny Url](https://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=) - this helped me to generate the shorten url for the link which is put inside the form.

## Acknowledgments

when I do this challenge I got some issue with the api stuff. the API hich is provided with this challenge doesn't work. I have searched the posts which are posted related to this challenge. this alternative API(I have mentioned above at the useful resources) which is recommended by [@Shaswat0707](https://github.com/Shaswat0707) has helped me and I want to say thanks for that.
